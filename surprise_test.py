pred = algo.predict(uid, iid, r_ui=4, verbose=True)


# What are raw and inner ids
# Users and items have a raw id and an inner id. 
# Some methods will use/return a raw id (e.g. the predict() method), while some other will use/return an inner id.

# Raw ids are ids as defined in a rating file or in a pandas dataframe. 
# They can be strings or numbers. Note though that if the ratings were read from a file which is the standard scenario, they are represented as strings. 
# This is important to know if youâ€™re using e.g. predict() or other methods that accept raw ids as parameters.

# On trainset creation, each raw id is mapped to a unique integer called inner id, which is a lot more suitable for Surprise to manipulate. 
# Conversions between raw and inner ids can be done using the to_inner_uid(), to_inner_iid(), to_raw_uid(), and to_raw_iid() methods of the trainset.
